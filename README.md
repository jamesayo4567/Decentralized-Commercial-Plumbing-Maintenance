# Decentralized Commercial Plumbing Maintenance System

## Overview

The Decentralized Commercial Plumbing Maintenance System is a blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize how commercial properties manage their plumbing infrastructure. By leveraging smart contracts and IoT integration, the system provides transparent, immutable records of plumbing systems, automated maintenance scheduling, and real-time water usage monitoring to prevent costly issues before they occur.

## Core Components

The system consists of four primary smart contracts that work together to create a comprehensive plumbing management solution:

1. **Building Registration Contract**: Establishes digital identities for commercial structures within the network, including essential details such as location, size, age, occupancy patterns, and ownership information.

2. **System Inventory Contract**: Creates a complete digital twin of the building's plumbing infrastructure, tracking fixtures, pipes, water heaters, and other components with their specifications, installation dates, and maintenance histories.

3. **Maintenance Scheduling Contract**: Manages inspection and repair workflows through automated scheduling, technician verification, and work quality assurance mechanisms.

4. **Water Usage Contract**: Monitors consumption patterns through IoT device integration, identifies potential leaks or inefficiencies, and facilitates data-driven conservation efforts.

## Key Benefits

- **Preventative Maintenance**: Systematically scheduled inspections help prevent costly emergency repairs
- **Leak Detection**: Early identification of abnormal water usage patterns to minimize damage and waste
- **Transparent History**: Immutable records of maintenance activities accessible to all stakeholders
- **Automated Compliance**: Streamlined record-keeping for regulatory requirements
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Comprehensive analytics to inform system upgrades and optimizations
- **Trusted Service Verification**: Confirmation that scheduled maintenance was properly performed
- **Resource Conservation**: Monitoring tools to improve water usage efficiency and sustainability
